This file collects important data on your matches,
allows you to sort them by last_activity_date, age,
gender, message count, and their average successRate.

The only thing that is not supported on this is 
getting your matches distance as this requires a
different api call [api.get_person(id)] which would
severely slow down the data collection into match_info.

So, since it is not entirely important to have distance,
we will proceed without it. Perhaps further down the road
I will cache this information so that it does not have to 
be re-retrieved every time you refresh your match updates.
